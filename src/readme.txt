Instructions: Run the program by clicking on the icon. When the program opens, you will be presented with appointments
and customers. Click add to add either. Click on one in the table and then click modify to modify.

DB settings are stored in the MySQLDB class file.

Reports: In addition to the two required reports, there is a report that generates a histogram that shows the frequency
of appointments by day of the week. This report will work best if there are several appointments in the database.
